This uses a random effects hierarchical model for inference and prediction in the phenomenological VPSC model

Unknown parameters:
Voce hardening parameters (thetas)
Random effects precision matrix (Lambda)
Observation error precision (delta)

Here, we make the assumption the observation error is i.i.d

The Voce hardening parmeters (thetas) are sampled in a Metropolis-Hastings step and both precisions (Lambda and delta)
are sampled from full-conditionals in Gibbs steps

The optimal proposal covariance matrices are found through an adaptation based on the covariance of the 
accepted parameters, the acceptance rates and the target acceptance rates

Parameters are proposed and accepted/rejected in blocks, where each block consists of the model parameters
for each random effect

Observations of the state were generated with the physics-based elasto-viscoplastic FFT model, and only the plastic 
region was used in the calibration of the VPSC model.  This allows us to make the reasonable assumption that the model
is correct and model discrepancy is not included in this simulation
